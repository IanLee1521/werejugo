# werejugo

Version 0.5 - beta

Identifies physical locations where a laptop has been based upon multiple forensics artifacts on host. Including:

- Wireless Profiles in SOFTWARE registry hive
- Wireless SSID from WLAN_AUTOCONFIG Application Event logs
- *Wireless Diagnostic Event ID 6100 in SYSTEM.EVTX
- **Wireless Profile Names from SRUM.DAT

**NOTE**: Google disabled this API in September on 2017.  I'll have to rewrite this to use a different API which will most likely require you to obtain API keys.

** Not yet implemented.

Resolving geolocation of the Wireless profiles stored in the SOFTWARE registry hive is done with Wigle.net's API.  You have to obtain a wigle.net API username and password.   The API username and password are differnt than your normal API username and password.   After creating a free account go to http://wigle.net/account and click the "SHOW MY TOKEN".  Then use API NAME (username) and API TOKEN (password).  These are passed as the `-u` and `-p` arguments

If you don't have a wigle.net account you can still use the Event Log based resolution.  The event log resolution looks for Microsoft Diagnotic Code 6100 event logs.  It finds Wifi information in the event log and geolocates it.

Example 1 - Analyze SOFTWARE registry hive and WLAN AUTO CONFIG files,do not geolocate with Wigle and create default output file called werejugo_output.xlsx:
`werejugo.exe -r SOFTWARE -w Microsoft-Windows-WLAN-AutoConfig.evtx`

Example 2 - Geolocate any 6100 event logs entries in the System event log and create a file called eventsonly.xlsx
`werejugo.exe -e z:\c\windows\system32\Winevt\Logs\System.evtx -o eventsonly.xlsx`

Example 3 - Geolocate the Wireless APs in multiple software registry hive files all starting with the word SOFTWARE in the current directory.
`werejugo.exe -r SOFTWARE*.* -u "wigleapiuser" -p "wigleapipassword" -o results.xlsx`

(**NOTE:** attemping to analyze either the System.evtx or SOFTWARE registry hive on live systems probably won't work because of file locks)

```
usage: werejugo.py [-h] [--IMAGE_MOUNT_POINT IMAGE_MOUNT_POINT]
                    [--SOFTWARE_REGISTRY SOFTWARE_REGISTRY]
                    [--SYSTEM_EVENTS SYSTEM_EVENTS]
                    [--WLAN_EVENTS WLAN_EVENTS] [--OUTPUT OUTPUT]
                    [--WIGLE_USER WIGLE_USER] [--WIGLE_PASS WIGLE_PASS]
```

Given a directory of SOFTWARE registry hives it will enumerate all the
wireless.
